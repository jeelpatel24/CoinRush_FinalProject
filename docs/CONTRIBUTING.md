# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Guidelines:
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make changes and keep commits focused and atomic.
3. Update Docs/ files if behavior or controls change.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and link to any issue.

Coding standards:
- Use clear, descriptive names.
- Add comments where logic is non-obvious.
- Keep Unity scenes/source under version control sensibly (avoid large binary churn when possible).

If you'd like help setting up a development environment, open an issue.
